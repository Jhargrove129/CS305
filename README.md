# CS305

As a developer at Global Rain, a company that specializes in custom software design and development, I was promoted to a new agile scrum team tasked with securing client software systems. One of our key clients, Artemis Financial, is a consulting firm that creates personalized financial plans for individuals, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wanted to modernize its operations and ensure its RESTful web API was protected against external threats. As part of Global Rain’s mission, “Security is everyone’s responsibility,” I was responsible for identifying and mitigating software security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial’s web-based application.

To address the client's concerns, I conducted a comprehensive vulnerability assessment that included both automated and manual code reviews. I focused on detecting common issues such as input validation errors, outdated dependencies, weak authentication logic, and insecure data transmission. One of the key strengths of my approach was the use of industry-standard frameworks, such as the OWASP Top 10, to guide the evaluation process. I documented each finding clearly and offered prioritized recommendations for remediation. This not only helped improve the security of the application but also strengthened Artemis Financial’s compliance with data protection regulations.

Secure coding is critical in protecting sensitive financial data and preserving client trust. It prevents breaches, reduces the risk of downtime, and ensures that systems are resilient to attacks. Software security contributes to a company’s long-term success by safeguarding its reputation and reducing potential legal and financial liabilities. One of the most challenging aspects of the assessment was working with legacy code that lacked documentation, but tools like OWASP ZAP, Snyk, and manual review methods helped identify hidden vulnerabilities effectively.

To increase layers of security, I implemented input sanitization, enforced HTTPS for secure communication, applied proper access controls, and strengthened session management protocols. I also made sure to use role-based access controls and enabled appropriate security headers. After refactoring the code, I ran unit tests, integration tests, and dynamic application security tests to ensure functionality was preserved and no new vulnerabilities were introduced. I used static code analysis and continuous integration tools to automate part of this process and catch any overlooked issues early.

Resources like Snyk, GitHub Dependabot, OWASP guidelines, and Postman for API testing proved extremely valuable during this project and will continue to be helpful in future assignments. If an employer were to ask for examples of my completed work, I would present the vulnerability assessment report, code before-and-after samples, and a description of the tools and practices I used. This project clearly demonstrates my ability to analyze, secure, and improve real-world software applications, and showcases my commitment to building secure and reliable solutions.
